# Gemini Text-prompt

I just made this project for testing how can i use gemini prompt module on my nodejs backend and make some front-end request to the nodejs backend and then prompt to the gemini model after all it'll send the response to the server. in this case if you wanna make some custom response for the frontend you may do that. but, i just do focus on hwo it's works.

if you wanna run this project yourself. you'll need some gemini api key for this.

if you need any help from me feel free to contact me via my website
